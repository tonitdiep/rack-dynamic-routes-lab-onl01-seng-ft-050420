  # if it has the item the response would be the item price if not you would set the response status to 404 and have the response be Item not found
  # 1. Your application should only accept the `/items/<ITEM NAME>` route. Everything else should `404`
  # 2. If a user requests `/items/<Item Name>` it should return the price of that item
  # 3. IF a user requests an item that you don't have, then return a `400` and an error message
